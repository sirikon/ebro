# Ebro

Ebro is a task runner. Tasks are defined inside YAML files, scripted with Bash, and configured with a name, requirements, when to skip execution, and other details.

Ebro is distributed as a single binary, including the script interpreter ([mvdan/sh](https://github.com/mvdan/sh)).

It's heavily inspired in [go-task/task](https://github.com/go-task/task), but originally built around a personal need for configuring servers, although it's not tied to this use case.

Check the [ðŸ“š Documentation](./docs/README.md) to learn more.
