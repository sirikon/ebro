## New Features

- Ability to filter tasks in the `-list` command with the `--filter` flag, using an [expr](https://expr-lang.org/) expression.
- New fields:
  - `labels` for defining key/value metadata. Ebro does nothing with this information and is intended for filtering purposes or for being consumed by third party tools.
  - `interactive` for flagging tasks as interactive. Interactive tasks receive the environment's `stdin` during execution.
- New environment variables available for all tasks:
  - `EBRO_BIN` is the absolute path to Ebro's binary.
  - `EBRO_TASK_ID` is the current task's ID (`:module:task`).
  - `EBRO_TASK_MODULE` is the current task's module (`:module`).
  - `EBRO_TASK_NAME` is the current task's name (`task`).

## Breaking Changes

- `import.from` parameter does not support Bash environment variable expansion anymore.
